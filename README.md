Despite receiving great attention, but Adidas' average rating is only 3.37/5, and Nike's is 2.79/5, 3.37 is a temporary acceptable rating, but with Adidas' prices and discounts for customers compared to With Nike, this rating is quite low. This can be due to many other factors such as quality, design, or after-sales service of the brand.  \
  As for Adidas, the Adidas CORE/NEO product line has more than 54 thousand reviews, accounting for more than 40% of the total reviews of Adidas, and the lowest is Adidas SPORT PERFORMANCE with more than 30,000 reviews, which can be explained because Adidas CORE/NEO has a large number of reviews.
